### WiFi Switch Pinout

```txt
      JP1
GND   [] ()   TXD
GND   [] ()   RXD

```

###  Flashing

Connect a UART programmer to the WiFi Switch in the following way:

| MyStrom PIN | Programmer |
| ----------- | :--------: |
| GND         |    GND     |
| VCC         |    3V3     |
| TXD         |    TXD     |
| RXD         |    RXD     |
| GPIO0       |    GND     |

If you use dupont wires it may be possible to connect these without soldering.
